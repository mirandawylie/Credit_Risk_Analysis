# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
### Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. 
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, 6 different machine learning models were applied to the dataset to determine which is the best machine learning model to predict credit risk.

## Results
### The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate the six following models using resampling.

* Oversample with RandomOverSampler algorithm

* Oversample with SMOTE algorithm

* Undersample with ClusterCentroids algorithm

* Over and undersampling with SMOTEENN algorithm

* Reduce bias with BalancedRandomForestClassifier

* Reduce bias with EasyEnsembleClassifier

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
